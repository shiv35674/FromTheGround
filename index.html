                <p class = "text">Good businesses need good plans. You don't need a complex business plan to make a business successful, but you should have a plan that is well thought out and executed. This includes considering your finances, product development, distribution and marketing plans. Develop a structure for your organization and then adhere to the processes you've defined.</p>

            <p> So when I came upon this website, and their assurances that no charge goes through to the credit card until they find the item and guarantee it’s delivery, I was very pleased. When I then proceeded with my purchase And received delivery of my watch in one day, in perfect and new condition, I was convinced. Great website great concierge service.</p>
